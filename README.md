# opentelemetry-py
A Flask-based web server instrumented with OpenTelemetry, designed to demonstrate observability best practices across the software delivery lifecycle—from local development to production-ready deployments in Kubernetes.

This repository highlights a progressive approach to implementing distributed tracing, metrics, and logging with modern tooling and automation.

## Project Overview
This project is designed to:

* Showcase practical use of OpenTelemetry (tracing, metrics, logging)
* Demonstrate containerization and Kubernetes deployment patterns
* Implement CI/CD pipelines using GitOps tools
* Integrate a full observability stack suitable for modern microservices

## Staged Roadmap
### Stage 1: Local Instrumentation
- Develop a minimal Flask web server
- Instrument the application with OpenTelemetry SDK:

    - Traces
    - Metrics
    - Logs

- Output telemetry data to the console

<b> Objective: </b>
Demonstrate local observability integration using a lightweight Python service.

### Stage 2: Containerization and Deployment
- Dockerize the application
- Define Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts
- Deploy to a Kubernetes cluster
- Integrate ArgoCD for GitOps-driven continuous deployment

<b> Objective: </b>
Transition to a production-like environment with automated infrastructure management.

### Stage 3: Full Observability Integration
- Export telemetry data to an OpenTelemetry Collector
- Integrate with backends:
    - Traces: Jaeger or Tempo
    - Metrics: Prometheus
    - Visualization: Grafana

- Implement contextual logging and custom application metrics

<b> Objective: </b>
Establish a complete observability pipeline across the application and infrastructure layers.

### Stage 4: Production Readiness
- Add application health endpoints and probes
- Secure communication with TLS/mTLS where appropriate
- Configure Kubernetes RBAC and network policies

<b> Objective: </b>
Enhance reliability and security to meet production-grade standards.

### Stage 5: Performance and Optimization
- Conduct load testing using tools like Locust or k6
- Use trace and metrics data to identify performance bottlenecks
- Optimize application code and Kubernetes resources based on findings

<b> Objective: </b>
Apply telemetry-driven insights to improve performance and scalability.

### Stage 6: Autoscaling and Alerting
- Enable Horizontal Pod Autoscaling based on Prometheus metrics
- Define Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Indicators (SLIs)
- Configure alerting rules and integrate with notification systems

<b> Objective: </b>
Make observability actionable by enabling dynamic scaling and proactive monitoring.
